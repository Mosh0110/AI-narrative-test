After repairs, the value increased by 150%. I need to find out how much profit he made.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what the value of the house is after the repairs. The increase is 150%, but 150% of what? It must be 150% of the original value before repairs, right? Because the repairs increased the value based on the original.\n\nHe bought it for $80,000, so that's the original value. Then he put in $50,000 for repairs, and that increased the value by 150% of the original value.\n\nSo, increase in value = 150% of $80,000.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n150% of $80,000 is (150/100) * 80,000 = 1.5 * 80,000.\n\n1.5 * 80,000 = 120,000.\n\nSo, the value increased by $120,000.\n\nTherefore, the new value after repairs is original value plus increase: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.\n\nHe spent money on buying and repairing: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n\nSo, profit should be the selling price minus the total cost. But the problem doesn't say he sold it. It just asks for profit, but in the context, I think we assume he sells it at the new value.\n\nLet me read the problem again.\n\n\"Josh decides to try flipping a house. He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?\"\n\nIt doesn't explicitly say he sold it, but flipping implies he sells it after renovation. So, I think we need to find the profit from the sale.\n\nProfit would be the selling price minus the total investment.\n\nTotal investment is purchase price plus repair cost: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n\nSelling price is the new value, which we calculated as $200,000.\n\nSo, profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nThe increase is 150%. Is that 150% of the original value or something else?\n\nSometimes percentages can be tricky. For example, if it said \"increased to 150%\", that would be different, but it says \"increased by 150%\", which means it was added 150% of the original.\n\nOriginal value: $80,000\n\nIncrease: 150% of original = 1.5 * 80,000 = $120,000\n\nNew value: 80,000 + 120,000 = $200,000\n\nTotal cost: 80,000 + 50,000 = $130,000\n\nProfit: 200,000 - 130,000 = $70,000\n\nBut is the increase based on the original value or the value after repairs? The problem says \"increased the value of the house by 150%\", and it doesn't specify, but typically, it's based on the original value before the increase.\n\nMoreover, the repairs cost $50,000, but the increase is in value, not directly related to the cost.\n\nAnother way to think: sometimes people might think that the increase is 150% of the repair cost, but that doesn't make sense because it says \"increased the value of the house\", not the value added by repairs.\n\nLet me read carefully: \"This increased the value of the house by 150%.\"\n\n\"This\" refers to the repairs, I think. So, the repairs caused the value to increase by 150%.\n\nBut 150% of what? It must be 150% of the original value, I believe.\n\nIf it were 150% of the repair cost, that would be different, but that seems unlikely.\n\nFor example, if increase was 150% of repair cost, then increase = 150% of $50,000 = 1.5 * 50,000 = $75,000.\n\nThen new value = original + increase = 80,000 + 75,000 = $155,000.\n\nTotal cost = 80,000 + 50,000 = $130,000.\n\nProfit = 155,000 - 130,000 = $25,000.\n\nBut that seems too low, and I think the first interpretation is more standard.\n\nThe problem says \"increased the value by 150%\", and in context, it's common to refer to the original value.\n\nMoreover, 150% increase on $80,000 is $120,000, making it $200,000, which is 2.5 times the original, since 100% + 150% = 250% or 2.5 times.\n\nOriginal 100%, increase 150%, so new is 250% of original, which is 2.5 * 80,000 = $200,000. Same as before.\n\nNow, profit is revenue minus cost, but we need to know the selling price. Since he flipped it, we assume he sells at new value.\n\nPerhaps the profit is just the increase minus repair cost or something, but I think we need the net profit from the whole transaction.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the 150% increase is based on the after-repair value or something, but that doesn't make sense because the increase is due to repairs.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me see if there's another way.\n\nSuppose the original value is V = $80,000.\n\nRepair cost C = $50,000.\n\nAfter repairs, value increased by 150%, so increase = 1.5 * V = 1.5 * 80,000 = 120,000.\n\nNew value = V + increase = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000.\n\nTotal cost to Josh: purchase + repairs = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000.\n\nIf he sells at new value, profit = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000.\n\nIf he doesn't sell, but the question is about profit from flipping, so he must sell.\n\nPerhaps the profit is the increase minus repair cost, but that would be 120,000 - 50,000 = 70,000, same thing.\n\nIncrease is 120,000, which is the gain in value, but he spent 50,000 to get that gain, so net from repairs is 120,000 - 50,000 = 70,000, but he also had the original house, so when he sells, he gets the new value, but he paid for the original, so overall profit is (new value) - (purchase + repairs) = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000.\n\nThe net from the repair investment is 70,000, but since he bought the house, the profit includes that.\n\nI think 70,000 is consistent.\n\nBut let me see if the increase could be misinterpreted.\n\nAnother common mistake: sometimes people think \"increased by 150%\" means it becomes 150%, but that would be increased to 150%, not by 150%.\n\nFor example, if it increased to 150%, then new value is 150% of original, so 1.5 * 80,000 = 120,000.\n\nThen profit = 120,000 - 130,000 = -10,000, a loss, which doesn't make sense for flipping.\n\nThe problem says \"increased by 150%\", not \"to 150%\".\n\nSo, it must be an increase of 150%, meaning added 150%.\n\nIn English, \"increased by 150%\" means the increase is 150% of the original value.\n\nYes.\n\nTo be thorough, let's consider the percentage point.\n\nBut I think it's clear.\n\nPerhaps the 150% is relative to the repair cost, but the sentence is \"increased the value of the house by 150%\", so it's the value that increased by 150%, so it should be based on the house value, not repair cost.\n\nFor example, if it said \"the repairs increased the value by 150% of the repair cost\", but it doesn't say that.\n\nIt just says \"increased the value of the house by 150%\", implying 150% of the house's original value.\n\nI think I should go with $70,000.\n\nBut let me see the numbers: 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 cost.\n\nValue after: 200,000.\n\nProfit 70,000.\n\nAs a percentage, but not asked.\n\nPerhaps I should express it.\n\nAnother thing: the profit is $70,000, but is that the answer?\n\nBut let me see if there's any other interpretation.\n\nSuppose the increase is 150% of the repair cost.\n\nThen increase = 150% of 50,000 = 75,000.\n\nNew value = 80,000 + 75,000 = 155,000.\n\nCost = 130,000.\n\nProfit = 155,000 - 130,000 = 25,000.\n\nBut that seems arbitrary, and the problem doesn't specify that the percentage is of the repair cost.\n\nThe phrase is \"increased the value of the house by 150%\", so it's the value that increased by 150%, so it should be based on the house value.\n\nIn business, when we say the value increased by a percentage, it's usually from the original value.\n\nFor example, if a stock increases by 10%, it's 10% of the original price.\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nI think $70,000 is correct.\n\nBut let me calculate the percentage increase based on cost or something.\n\nTotal investment: 130,000.\n\nNew value: 200,000.\n\nSo profit 70,000.\n\nThe increase in value is 120,000, cost to achieve that is 50,000, so net gain 70,000 from repairs, but since he owns the asset, the profit is realized on sale.\n\nI think I'm circling.\n\nPerhaps the question is tricking me with the repair cost.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the \"150%\" is applied after something, but I think not.\n\nPerhaps the value increased by 150% means it became 250% of original, which I have.\n\nI think I should go with $70,000.\n\nBut let me see if the answer makes sense.\n\nOriginal value 80,000.\n\nAfter repairs, 200,000.\n\nHe spent 50,000 on repairs, so the value added is 120,000, which is more than the repair cost, so he made a profit.\n\nProfit 70,000.\n\nIf he had no repair, he could sell at 80,000, but he bought at 80,000, so no profit, but with repairs, he sells at 200,000 with 50,000 cost, so profit 70,000.\n\nThe increase due to repairs is 120,000, minus repair cost 50,000, so 70,000 additional profit, but since he had no profit before, total profit 70,000.\n\nYes.\n\nI think it's consistent.\n\nSo, profit is $70,000.\n\nBut the problem says \"how much profit did he make?\" and it should be in dollars.\n\nPerhaps I need to box the answer.\n\nBut let me see if there's a different interpretation.\n\nSuppose the 150% is of the current value or something, but that would be circular.\n\nFor example, if the increase is 150% of the new value, but that doesn't make sense because the increase is part of the new value.\n\nLet new value be V.\n\nThen increase is V - 80,000.\n\nBut it says increase is 150% of something.\n\nIf it were 150% of new value, then V - 80,000 = 1.5 * V, which would be negative, impossible.\n\nIf 150% of original, then V - 80,000 = 1.5 * 80,000, so V = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000, same as before.\n\nIf 150% of repair cost, V - 80,000 = 1.5 * 50,000 = 75,000, so V = 155,000.\n\nBut I think the first is correct.\n\nI think I should conclude.\n\nSo, profit is $70,000.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n", "gold_answer": "70000"}]
